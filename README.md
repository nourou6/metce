METCE - 'Modèle pour l'Échange des informations sur le Temps, le Climat et l'Eau' (METCE), or it may also be known as the ‘METeorological 
Community Exchange’ model in English, is the WMO Logical Data Model developed with an intention to provide conceptual definitions of 
meteorological phenomena, entities and concepts in order to underpin semantic interoperability in the weather, climate and water domain.  

Currently METCE has three packages, namely metce, opm and collect. 

The similarly named package metce in this repository provides a set of foundation building blocks that can be built into an application 
schema.
